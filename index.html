        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is designed to guide them in learning a culture, molding their behaviour in the ways of adulthood, and directing them toward their eventual role in society. In the most primitive cultures, there is often little formal learning—little of what one would ordinarily call school or classes or teachers. Instead, the entire environment and all activities are frequently viewed as school and classes, and many or all adults act as teachers. As societies grow more complex, however, the quantity of knowledge to be passed on from one generation to the next becomes more than any one person can know, and, hence, there must evolve more selective and efficient means of cultural transmission. The outcome is formal education—the school and the specialist called the teacher.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Digital technology, with its many tentacles of communication hacking and information sharing, has breathed fresh life into classroom learning. Usage of digital boards and multimedia content leads to increased attention and engagement of the students and better interaction between teachers and students. Learning has become more interesting and animated for pupils, while on the other hand, teachers also feel less burdened with the easy availability of quality content on the internet.With digital learning and digital learning tools learning becomes easier and more flexible. Students can now learn on their own pace and even use different varieties of software programs that they are more familiar with for their learning to be more convenient and for them to get the best out of their education.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The current face of Education in the nation is actually turning out to be a major “silent hindrance” for India’s track to greater development. While all the attention is on social-political issues, it should quickly be turned on to educational reforms. Education has the power to all solve issues(wars, unemployment, waste management, corruption etc), in the long run, and a must for a developing country like India it cannot be ignored, not to say it is being ignored, India spends a lot of Education( somewhat only 2nd after defence), the results aren’t actually visible….
            
            We need to completely revamp the system of education. Focus on work experience and adapting to a 21st-century skill set should be on the key agenda list…</p>
